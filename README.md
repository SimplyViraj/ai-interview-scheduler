This project is an AI-powered interview scheduling system that helps candidates and interviewers find suitable interview time slots automatically. Instead of manually coordinating schedules through emails or messages, the system allows users to enter their availability in natural language, and the application intelligently matches overlapping time slots.

Candidates can submit their availability and request interviews with interviewers. Interviewers can view these requests, submit their own availability, and let the system compute the best possible overlapping interview slots. The interviewer can then confirm a suitable slot, after which both participants receive an email notification with a calendar invite.

The system reduces scheduling conflicts, saves time, and makes the interview process smoother by automating availability parsing, slot matching, and confirmation.
